But the state of Italy, founded in 1861, is younger than the United States. At the intersection of these two facts lies the main theme of our journey from the Napoleonic invasion of Italy to the approval of the constitution of the Republic of Italy: the difficulty faced by the political leaders of united Italy in getting its citizens to identify with the Italian state. Historical accounts and documents, integrated with a selection of literary, operatic, and cinematic materials, constitute the main sources of information and analysis.", "year": 2014, "department": "IT", "instructors": ["gconti"], "crn": 48176, "sessions": [], "name": "(Arezzo) Italy From Napoleon to the First Republic"}
{"semester": "spring", "course_number": "244", "description": "When we look at works of art in museums, galleries, and churches we are, in most cases, looking at them out of context. Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo.", "year": 2014, "department": "IT", "instructors": ["stocchip"], "crn": 48187, "sessions": [], "name": "Art, Architecture, and Literature in the Age of Dante and Beyond (Arezzo)"}

What is the relationship between written and spoken language? How does manual gesture relate to spoken language, and to sign language? How do languages develop? Die? How are they related? In exploring these questions we will confront a variety of common misperceptions about language.  Each lecture has reading assignments drawn from the textbook and published articles.
