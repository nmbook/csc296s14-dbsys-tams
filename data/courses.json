Today art circulates in a globalized economy in which the means of production and reproduction tends to militate against a more nuanced understanding of the role of technology in art. Yet technology, from the classical Greek techne, meaning art or skill, is equally applicable to the art of the pre-modern period. From the earliest cave paintings to the Gothic cathedrals, from ancient Greek bronzes to the Renaissance altarpiece, technology has been central to the making of art. Yet if these representational modes have been formerly regarded as incommensurate, the result of radically different epistemologies, increasingly historians and theorists of the visual arts have begun to acknowledge a commonality of goals between these techniques.

What steps must we take to become more just and more egalitarian? What can art tell us about justice? What can justice tell us about art? The worlds most powerful minds have wrestled with these questions, and the answers they have posed shape our contemporary global debates. In this unique course, taught by multiple faculty from across the humanities and social sciences, we will consider different conceptions of justice and equality, with special attention to their relevance to the contemporary moment. Beginning with Platos Republic , we will address works by such thinkers as Rousseau, Mary Wollstonecraft, Franz Fanon, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Martin Luther King. Students and faculty from multiple sections of this course will occasionally meet as one group to analyze how different disciplines confront these complex topics.

{"description": "The World Wide Web was born around 1990, so it is not much older than most of you. In this course, we will follow the growth of the Web from its toddler years, to early childhood, to its turbulent pre-teen and teenage years, and finally as it begins to mature as a young adult. Along this journey, you will learn influential Web technologies such as HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, the LAMP stack, XML, JSON, Ajax, WebSockets, and modern MVC frameworks. Even though you will be doing a lot of programming in this course, its purpose is not to teach you to become an expert in any particular language or framework.

How do Christians distinguish themselves from Jews in the eyes of pagans? How do Jews respond to the challenges presented by the emergence of Christianity?

{"description": "This introductory level course is designed for students who have no background in linguistics, with some new topics for students who do. The course addresses the basic question \"What is Language?\" from a broad variety of perspectives including linguistics, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, sign language linguistics and gesture study. We will consider questions such as: What elements are found in all human languages? Are they systematically organized or random? Are some languages/dialects better than others? What is the relationship between written and spoken language? How does manual gesture relate to spoken language, and to sign language? How do languages develop? Die? How are they related? In exploring these questions we will confront a variety of common misperceptions about language.  Each lecture has reading assignments drawn from the textbook and published articles.

The Jesus Movement eventually separates itself from its Jewish origins and emerges, as Christianity, as a significant new religious group in the ancient world. How do Christians distinguish themselves from Jews in the eyes of pagans? How do Jews respond to the challenges presented by the emergence of Christianity? Why is Christianity perceived as such a threat by the Romans? We will explore all of these questions as well as the difficult issues of the nature of religious conflict, the problem of religious polemic, and the origins of anti-semitism.", "sessions": [{"start_time": "12:30:00", "end_time": "13:45:00", "weekday": "M", "room": "RRLIB 442"}, {"start_time": "12:30:00", "end_time": "13:45:00", "weekday": "W", "room": "RRLIB 442"}], "instructors": ["ameridet"], "semester": "spring", "course_number": "211", "year": 2014, "department": "REL", "position_count": 4, "crn": 76215, "name": "Jews, Pagans and Christians"}

As a filmmaker, he drew on these generic traditions and manipulated them in aesthetically and politically provocative ways, determined, like his New German Cinema contemporaries, to use the cinema as a site of historical re-vision and dissent.
