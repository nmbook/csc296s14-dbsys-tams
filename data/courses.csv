We will use anthropological approaches to explore the variety of ways violence, memory, justice, and reconciliation are understood around the world, focusing particularly in Africa. We will explore critically the ideology behind transitional justice mechanisms such as truth commissions, criminal trials, and memorials, and their diverse impacts in specific contexts. We will ask, How do we understand violence and the challenges of social recovery? What is the relationship between rule of law, political stability, and peace? How do legal solutions balance local realities and culture with universal standards of law and human rights? How do legal solutions define peace and justice, truth and punishment, and manage tensions between them?	\N	0
10103	2014	spring	AAS	242	Urban Change and City Politics	Through intensive reading and discussion, we examine the politics and history of American cities. While we read scholarship drawing on the experiences of an array of cities--including Chicago, New York, Detroit, Boston, Oakland, Philadelphia, San Diego, Albuquerque, Phoenix, New Haven, Atlanta, Buffalo, and Charlotte--our emphasis is on commonalities in the urban experience as well as on systematic differences. We analyze the relationship of cities to their hinterlands in the early stages of urban development, the rise of ethnic neighborhoods, suburbanization, industrialization, de-industrialization, housing and jobs, concentrated poverty, and population changes. Race, ethnicity, and class are central to this course, not only in understanding changes in neighborhoods but also in the nature of politics and governmental arrangements.	\N	0

10557	2014	spring	AEC	511	Advanced Price Theory I	The first of a three-course sequence providing a survey of the substance and methods of contemporary price theory for students preparing to do research. Generally, the first course covers the economic behavior of individuals and firms in a competitive market setting. Individual behaviors examined include responses to price and income changes, intertemporal planning (e.g., saving), household production, labor supply, investment in human capital, search, and reactions to uncertainty about future assets and goods prices. For firms, the implications of value-maximization for input demands and output supplies are explored thoroughly. Managerial choices related to multiple products, intertemporal production planning and uncertainty are explicitly modeled. Some extensions to monopoly behavior are considered. Finally, some implications of consumer and competitive firm behavior for industry (single market) and general equilibrium are examined.	\N	0
10566	2014	spring	AEC	523	Adv Empirical Industrial Org	Empirical Industrial Organization (IO) methods have become an integral element of the applied econometricians' tool kit across many areas. Applications of these methods are not limited to IO but are seen in diverse areas such as political science, labor economics, corporate finance and marketing. These methods stress combining strong IO theory with cutting edge econometrics to answer substantive questions. In addition to introducing students to new methods and topics, this course also aims to cultivate a strong research focus in our students. It encourages them to read and critically evaluate challenging papers and discuss approaches to improving them. As such, this course is in the best tradition of Simon's research approach.	\N	0
10579	2014	spring	AH	101	Intro to Art & Visual Culture	This course is designed to introduce the student to aspects of the history of Western painting, sculpture, & architecture from the Renaissance through the present. We will examine the various schools & movements in their historical contexts, while paying particular attention to the histories that bear upon them, such as the influence of the classical past, religion, gender, political power, & the rise of the artist. The course will therefore attempt two goals; one, to familiarize students with the principal monuments of the western tradition from about 1400 onward, that is, the paintings, sculptures, buildings, & artifacts which form the substance of this narrative; two, to develop visual literacy, that is, the ability not only to identify but also to discuss art works in a way that develops critical competence & an understanding of how the western tradition of art has come about.	\N	0
10582	2014	spring	AH	103	Ways of Seeing: Art & Identity in American Modernism	What is American about American Modernism?

To do so, we will explore important exchanges between Europe and the US, while considering the shifting geopolitical contours of the US in relation to Mexico and Latin America. Throughout, we will examine how increasing urbanization, industrialization and immigration, the advent of the railroad and faster modes of travel across the nation and continent, new technologies of vision, and war contributed to the diverse and often contradictory approaches dedicated to making sense of technological transformations across a changing nation. We will discuss key movements including: antimodernism, primitivism, the Arts and Crafts Movement, the Harlem Renaissance and art of the Works Progress Administration.	\N	0
10604	2014	spring	AH	112	Intro to Women's Studies: Middle Eastern Women in Graphic Novels and Comic Books	This course looks at representations of Middle Eastern women in different graphic novels and comic books that have proliferated in the last few years. Notions of gender, sexuality, patriarchy, and stereotypes will be examined as well as the question of authorship. Through the different readings we will locate pervasive ideologies from and about the Middle East, looking at the different ways authors deconstructed or perpetuated these ideologies. This course seeks to answer how the genre of graphic novels and comics has managed to redefine and change the image of the Middle Eastern woman, both within the genre itself and on a larger scale. Additionally, we will problematize the term Middle East and the concepts of local versus global throughout the course. Titles that will be considered include but are not limited to: Zahras Paradise, Embroideries, The 99, A\
Game for Swallows and Arab in America.	\N	0
10610	2014	spring	AH	114	Creating Architecture - An Introduction	Buildings are among the most public, visible & long lived artifacts that a culture creates.

This course fulfills one-half of the upper level writing requirement for both studio and art history majors.  Permission of instructor required.	\N	0
10706	2014	spring	AH	217	Technologies of Art	Technology is central to an understanding of science and engineering, but what of its application in the arts, in particular the visual arts? Today art circulates in a globalized economy in which the means of production and reproduction tends to militate against a more nuanced understanding of the role of technology in art. Yet technology, from the classical Greek techne, meaning art or skill, is equally applicable to the art of the pre-modern period. From the earliest cave paintings to the Gothic cathedrals, from ancient Greek bronzes to the Renaissance altarpiece, technology has been central to the making of art. Yet if these representational modes have been formerly regarded as incommensurate, the result of radically different epistemologies, increasingly historians and theorists of the visual arts have begun to acknowledge a commonality of goals between these techniques. With these observations in mind this course attempts to explore the application of technology to the visual arts.	\N	0
10722	2014	spring	AH	226	Monuments of Ancient Italy: History, Structure, Form (Taught in Arrezo Italy)	The course studies the archaeology and architecture of buildings in ancient Italy from the fifth century BC to the fourth century AD, adopting a multidisciplinary approach based on archeological evidence, technical and functional aspects, and historical significance.

10741	2014	spring	AH	244	Art, Architecture, and Literature in the Age of Dante and Beyond (Arezzo)	When we look at works of art in museums, galleries, and churches we are, in most cases, looking at them out of context. Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo.	\N	0

43019	2014	spring	FIN	205	Financial Management	This course centers on how a firm is funded, and on how financial management can help maximize the financial rewards to those who own the firm, while meeting the obligations of the firm to other stakeholders. The effect of timing on the value of cash flows is developed at length, and is applied to the valuation of bonds and stocks. Various facets of stocks and bonds are also introduced, and a brief overview of the stock market is presented. Cash flow concepts are then incorporated into a development of how investment opportunities are analyzed, which includes a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses associated with different analytical methods. The topics of capital market efficiency and portfolio theory are then discussed and tied in to the concept of what investors have sacrificed in order to invest in a firm. This, in turn, is tied in to which investments are worthwhile to a firm's owners. Students may not receive credit for both FIN 204 and FIN 205.	\N	0

45753	2014	spring	HIS	233	(Arezzo) Italy From Napoleon to the First Republic	The Italian peninsula has a history that goes back at least 2500 years. But the state of Italy, founded in 1861, is younger than the United States. At the intersection of these two facts lies the main theme of our journey from the Napoleonic invasion of Italy to the approval of the constitution of the Republic of Italy: the difficulty faced by the political leaders of united Italy in getting its citizens to identify with the Italian state. Historical accounts and documents, integrated with a selection of literary, operatic, and cinematic materials, constitute the main sources of information and analysis.	\N	0

48187	2014	spring	IT	244	Art, Architecture, and Literature in the Age of Dante and Beyond (Arezzo)	When we look at works of art in museums, galleries, and churches we are, in most cases, looking at them out of context. Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo.	\N	0

74713	2014	spring	WST	100	Intro to Women's Studies: Middle Eastern Women in Graphic Novels and Comic Books	This course looks at representations of Middle Eastern women in different graphic novels and comic books that have proliferated in the last few years. Notions of gender, sexuality, patriarchy, and stereotypes will be examined as well as the question of authorship. Through the different readings we will locate pervasive ideologies from and about the Middle East, looking at the different ways authors deconstructed or perpetuated these ideologies. This course seeks to answer how the genre of graphic novels and comics has managed to redefine and change the image of the Middle Eastern woman, both within the genre itself and on a larger scale. Additionally, we will problematize the term Middle East and the concepts of local versus global throughout the course. Titles that will be considered include but are not limited to: Zahras Paradise, Embroideries, The 99, A\
Game for Swallows and Arab in America.	\N	0

75122	2014	spring	PHY	525	Complexity	As the number of interacting degrees of freedom (or agents) in a given system increases, its behavior often changes qualitatively, and not only quantitatively. Complexity is the emerging field of research, which investigates the shared underlying concepts and principles of such systems. It finds its applications in Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, Biology, Social Sciences, Economy, and more.\
\	In this introductory course we will focus on these common features and their utilization in understanding complex systems. They will include for example: Fractals, non-linearity and chaos, adaptation and evolution, critical and tipping points, patterns formation, networks modeling, feedback loops, emergence and unpredictability, etc.\
\	Students in the course will be given ample opportunities to study farther these systems and/or techniques that are of particular interest to them.\

Is perception direct or independent upon the specifics of sensory input (Gibson, Reid)? Can we account for all of the features of perceptual experience in functional or compu-tational terms? Is perception a type of computation that transforms an (impoverished) sensory input into a type of internal representation (Marr)? Is perception best thought of as a hypothesis or inference about the world (Helmholtz; Shams & Beierholm)? Is perception separate from knowledge and cognition or does cognition permeate percep- tion? How do conscious beliefs about the world (e.g. that something is red) relate to sensory input (e.g. seeing a strawberry; Pylyshyn, Lupyan)? Does perceptual knowledge transfer across sensory modalities (Evans)?	\N	0

75299	2014	spring	HIS	154	History of Latin American Through Soccer	In this course, we will use soccer as a lens to study the development of modern Latin American history, culture and politics. British immigrants first introduced the beautiful game to Argentina in 1867, yet at the time soccer was viewed as a bizarre, violent, and foreign fad. This course will trace the trajectory of both the sport and the Latin American societies that received and molded soccer into the cultural force that it is today. Soccer has been used to fabricate national identities, promote multi-racial societies, and, of course, entertain the masses. We will explore these facets of its impact on twentieth-century Latin American history, while acknowledging the more odious use of the sport in upholding dictatorships, drug trafficking and misogyny. No prior knowledge of soccer or Latin American history is required.	\N	0

Some pursued their investigations topically (slavery, migration, economic development, etc.) and others focused on particular colonies or regions. We shift the focus of inquiry to the Atlantic Ocean itself, as the geographic center of an expanding European world. Rather than treat the ocean as peripheral while studying the settlement of the Atlantic coast, we will be primarily concerned with activities that took place upon its watery face, delving into the lives of the tens of thousands of mariners who were catalysts in identity formation, migration, and economic development. Our focus will be on three topics: migration, (forced and free), maritime activities (seafaring, shipping, and fishing), and trade (how merchants did business and integrated regional economies). By the end, you will hopefully appreciate the centrality of the sea to the development of Africa, Europe, and the Americas.	\N	0

76183	2014	spring	CSC	210	Web Programming	The World Wide Web was born around 1990, so it is not much older than most of you. In this course, we will follow the growth of the Web from its toddler years, to early childhood, to its turbulent pre-teen and teenage years, and finally as it begins to mature as a young adult. Along this journey, you will learn influential Web technologies such as HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, the LAMP stack, XML, JSON, Ajax, WebSockets, and modern MVC frameworks. Even though you will be doing a lot of programming in this course, its purpose is not to teach you to become an expert in any particular language or framework. Web technologies change at a blistering pace, so specifics quickly get outdated. However, once you take this course and understand the fundamentals, you will be able to easily pick up new technologies on the fly.	\N	0

76215	2014	spring	REL	211	Jews, Pagans and Christians	This course is an advanced seminar which focuses on religious conflict among Jews, Pagans, and Christians in the ancient world. We begin by examining the status of Jews in the Greco-Roman world and by investigating pagan responses (negative and positive) to Judaism. We study the rise of a new Jewish movement in the first century, namely, the Jesus Movement and focus on the development of the conflict between Jewish and non-Jewish followers of Jesus. The Jesus Movement eventually separates itself from its Jewish origins and emerges, as Christianity, as a significant new religious group in the ancient world. How do Christians distinguish themselves from Jews in the eyes of pagans? How do Jews respond to the challenges presented by the emergence of Christianity? Why is Christianity perceived as such a threat by the Romans? We will explore all of these questions as well as the difficult issues of the nature of religious conflict, the problem of religious polemic, and the origins of anti-semitism.	\N	0

76310	2014	spring	PHY	458	Geometric Methods in Fluids	This course will focus on applying methods of Riemannian geometry to fluid mechanics. At an elementary  level, it involves using curvilinear co-ordinates to solve Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in various geometries; e.g., rotating and self-gravitating fluids. At a deeper level, the Euler equations are the geodesic equations in the infinite dimensional group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. We can understand the instabilities of a fluid in terms of the sectional curvature of this space (the work of Arnold). Flow along the principal directions of this metric relates this back to "force-free" flows in fluid mechanics.

The comparative democratic political processes subfield focuses on choosing political leaders and making political decisions in the context of competitive elections and relative freedom of political action.  We begin by discussing the meaning and measures of contemporary democracy and the nature of democratic transitions. We then turn to political parties, as key institutions linking citizens and policymakers, and policymaking institutions. The second half includes the comparative study of individuals attitudes and behavior (political culture, voter choices, interest groups.) For graduate students the course fulfills requirements for an elective in comparative politics; however, no specific background is assumed and the course is appropriate for any graduate student.	\N	0

76636	2014	spring	HIS	105	Justice and Equality	What is justice? Is it universal or does it vary across cultures and over time? Does justice require equality? If so, equality of what? What steps must we take to become more just and more egalitarian? What can art tell us about justice? What can justice tell us about art? The worlds most powerful minds have wrestled with these questions, and the answers they have posed shape our contemporary global debates. In this unique course, taught by multiple faculty from across the humanities and social sciences, we will consider different conceptions of justice and equality, with special attention to their relevance to the contemporary moment.

77045	2014	spring	AAS	242W	Urban Change and City Politics	Through intensive reading and discussion, we examine the politics and history of American cities. While we read scholarship drawing on the experiences of an array of cities--including Chicago, New York, Detroit, Boston, Oakland, Philadelphia, San Diego, Albuquerque, Phoenix, New Haven, Atlanta, Buffalo, and Charlotte--our emphasis is on commonalities in the urban experience as well as on systematic differences. We analyze the relationship of cities to their hinterlands in the early stages of urban development, the rise of ethnic neighborhoods, suburbanization, industrialization, de-industrialization, housing and jobs, concentrated poverty, and population changes. Race, ethnicity, and class are central to this course, not only in understanding changes in neighborhoods but also in the nature of politics and governmental arrangements.	\N	0

77233	2014	spring	ENG	238	The Great War Revisited	With its unprecedented death toll and new technologies of destruction, WWI shattered illusions and exploded the fabric of society as people then knew it. Despite subsequent world conflicts and traumatic occurrences, the Great War has remained for the British a haunting presence, becoming, in poet Ted Hughess words, the number one national ghost. On the 100th anniversary of the wars inception, we will trace the history of this national obsession in the searing poetry of the trenches, the combatants memoirs that exposed the wars horror and futility, and the modernist fiction that registered the wars impact in new ways of seeing.

78115	2014	spring	ENG	100	Great Books: War	My goal is to introduce students to famous writings considered "great" that examine the nature of war, the strategies of war and political conduct, and the strategies of surviving war. That so many of our great works, especially our "epics," address and describe wars is a concern of the course. Where does heroism end and expediency begin? What long-lasting voices have been raised against war and the curtailment of freedom? What bonds are made or broken in war? The course is particularly interested in the relationships of men and women--men with men, men with women, women with women--in an institution long considered a masculine domain. Texts well cover are Sun Tzus Art of War, Aristotles Politics, Karl von Clauswitz On War, Gilgamesh, The Iliad, Aristophanes Lysistrata, Machiavellis Prince, Shakespeares Henry V,  Stephen Cranes Red Badge of Courage, Virginia Woolfs Three Guineas, Sherri Zemans The Kommandants Mistress and many more.	\N	0

Our aim will be to encounter these as challenging imaginative attempts to articulate and confront the possibilities of life. We will aim to understand and enjoy these texts in their own distinctive terms, but we will be concerned as well to see why readers have continuously returned to them, and how we are to make sense of them in the 21st century. The readings are astonishingly rich and rewarding, and we will try to do justice to them within the limits of a semester's work.	\N	0

79496	2014	spring	ENG	440	Introduction to Literary Theory	This course introduces students to several different 20th-century approaches to literary analysis: from New Criticism to Formalism to Structuralism to Deconstruction to New Historicism to feminist and postcolonial theory, various theoretical movements have asked fundamental questions about (and offered provisional hypotheses on) the nature of signification, interpretation, truth, and knowledge. Not just methods for reading, these approaches challenge us to rethink the relationship between representation and reality, language and life. Students will gain familiarity with all of the major schools of literary theory and engage with them critically through writing assignments and exams.	\N	0

79566	2014	spring	CLA	140	Classical & Scriptural Backgrounds	Our readings and discussions in this course will take in ancient myth and mythological figures, archeological backgrounds and historical contexts, art in various media, philosophical and intellectual traditions, and, in general, Large Questions (Love, Death, War, Sex, Law, Gender, and more). Above all, however, this is a course in literary study and appreciation: we will read the Iliad and the Odyssey, the Aeneid, some dialogues by Plato, a selection from the Greek drama, and a large selection of Hebrew and Christian scriptures. Our aim will be to encounter these as challenging imaginative attempts to articulate and confront the possibilities of life. We will aim to understand and enjoy these texts in their own distinctive terms, but we will be concerned as well to see why readers have continuously returned to them, and how we are to make sense of them in the 21st century. The readings are astonishingly rich and rewarding, and we will try to do justice to them within the limits of a semester's work.	\N	0

80799	2014	spring	ENG	396	Honors Seminar: Forms of Literary Criticism	What is literary criticism?  What does it mean to criticize or analyze a literary text, an authors oeuvre, a tradition?  This course models a deliberately broad range of answers to that question by looking at a diverse group of critical works, focused on different periods and genres within literary history, and representing various approaches to literary analysis.  By reading a different work of criticism each week, we will be able to assess their comparative strengths and weaknesses, their potential for insight or their particular blind spots.  But we will also be able to think about criticism itself as a form of writing, and to experience its unique powers and pleasures.  Along the way we will read some undisputed classics of criticism from the past fifty years or so and some important or striking recent works (including perhaps some future classics).

81135	2014	spring	AH	430	History of Photography	This survey course will provide an overview of photography from pre-photographic times to the present.  Given that there is no single history, but only histories of the medium, the course will explore a variety of approaches to the study of photography, its evolution in relation to other art forms and its role in the development of mass culture.  Students taking this course will gain a basic knowledge of photographic history, its major events, practitioners and theorists.  We will consider the photographic image in a range of contexts, including art, advertising, journalism and propaganda, and will explore the social, political and ethical consequences of photographic media in our culture.  This course will make extensive use of the collections of the International Museum of Film and Photography at the George Eastman House.	\N	0
81164	2014	spring	AME	196	On-the-Fly Audio Programming	In this course, students will explore digital audio synthesis and real-time interactive technologies by studying two audio programming languages, ChucK and Pure Data.

Students will have a midterm presentation to demonstrate their programs in ChucK and at the end of the semester, we will have an interactive performance showcase. This interdisciplinary course does not require any programming experience.	\N	0
81202	2014	spring	CAS	203	Gifting,Violn&Indebtedbod	Indebted bodies are, by definition, bodies that owe someone or some entity (e.g, a State or governmental agency) more than or something other than money; something that is non-quantifiable, non-monetary. Typically constructed as human objects, indebted bodies are obligated, not because of what they can buy or acquire but because of what they have been given. This class will deploy narrative, quantitative and ethnographic employment data from low status service workers, including, for example, college athletes, wait-staff, non-managerial hotel workers, maids and housekeepers, home health aides, etc. to interrogate the claim that gifting and giving are unconditional social goods.  The primary goal is to reinforce assigned course materials and seminar participants self-selected fieldsite data in order to engage the overarching seminar question: Is gifting indebted bodies a form of violence--by another name?	\N	0

81404	2014	spring	WST	263	Fassbinder	Rainer Werner Fassbinder might be characterized as the most prolific, influential and controversial German filmmaker of the New German Cinema. Between 1966 and 1982, he directed over 40 films and received over twenty awards for screenwriting, film direction and film production. A true cineaste, Fassbinder was a fan of the most varied genres including film noir, melodrama, the western, science fiction and the avant-garde. As a filmmaker, he drew on these generic traditions and manipulated them in aesthetically and politically provocative ways, determined, like his New German Cinema contemporaries, to use the cinema as a site of historical re-vision and dissent. In this course, we will use genre theory and dramatic theory, in particular the theories of Artaud and Brecht, as well as Fassbinders own writings to analyze his attempts to rouse the viewer out of passive consumption and demand a more reflective, politically-engaged spectatorship.	\N	0
81461	2014	spring	ECE	477	Computer Audition	Computer audition is the study of how to design a computational system that can analyze and process auditory scenes. Problems in this field include source separation (splitting audio mixtures into individual source tracks), pitch estimation (estimating the pitches played by each instrument), streaming (finding which sounds belong to a single event/source), source localization (finding where the sound comes from) and source identification (labeling a sound source).	\N	0
